In this project, we are talking about an automated system that includes whole watering system. 
An automated watering system is such a system that starts watering to plants by measuring soil moisture through soil moisture sensor.
In this project we will have some extra benefits. We donâ€™t need to control this watering, because the device will make this automatically when it will need it.
